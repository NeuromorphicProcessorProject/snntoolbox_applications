Examples
========

To set up an experiment with the SNN toolbox, we need to create a config file
as described in `the documentation <https://snntoolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/configuration.html>`_.
Here we show a number of examples of such configuration files.

    A. `LeNet on MNIST <ExampleA_>`_
    B. `BinaryConnect on CIFAR-10 <ExampleB_>`_
    C. `BinaryNet on CIFAR-10 <ExampleC_>`_
    D. `VGG-16 on ImageNet <ExampleD_>`_
    E. `Inception-V3 on ImageNet <ExampleE_>`_

These example applications contain the network architectures, parameters, the
configuration files for running the toolbox, as well as a subset of the data
sets. You can simply run them by typing ``snntoolbox -t <path_to_config>`` in
the terminal, where ``<path_to_config>`` is the path (including filename) to
the configuration file corresponding to that particular experiment.

.. note:: In order to successfully run the example models here, make sure the
   `Keras configuration file
   <https://keras.io/getting-started/faq/#where-is-the-keras-configuration-file-stored>`_
   contains the option ``"image_data_format": "channels_first"``.

.. _ExampleA:

Example A - LeNet on MNIST
--------------------------

Here we test the classic LeNet architecture on MNIST, using one implementation
in Keras, one in Lasagne, and one in Caffe.

Keras
.....

.. include:: lenet5/keras/config
    :literal:

The most important part to specify in the ``config`` file is the
``filename_ann`` and ``dataset_path`` parameter in the ``paths`` section. This
will tell the toolbox where to look for the input model and data.

It is possible to leave some settings like ``path_wd`` open; they will be
filled in with the default values. For instance, ``path_wd`` is set to the
directory where the ``config`` file lives.

Note how we can specify relative paths, or even refer to other options (like
``path_wd``) when building other paths. If only a filename (without path) is
given, or the path is relative, it is always assumed to be relative to the
``path_wd`` option.

In the ``simulation`` section we tell the toolbox how long and how many samples
to test.

Optionally, we can ask the toolbox to ``output`` plots and save some quantities
that were monitored during the simulation to disk.

.. note:: The model ``98.96.h5`` in the example above was trained using Keras
   version <= 2.1.6. If you installed the toolbox using a newer Keras version,
   this model may show a drop in accuracy because of a change in the Flatten
   layer. Downgrade Keras to maintain accuracy, or set ``filename_ann = 99.14``
   to use a model trained with Keras 2.2.4.

Caffe
.....

You need to have Caffe installed to run this example.

Here we need to change the ``model_lib`` option from default ``keras`` to
``caffe``. The ``filename_ann`` also changes, the rest can stay the same.

.. include:: lenet5/caffe/config
    :literal:

Lasagne
.......

You need to have Lasagne installed to run this example.

We can also use Poisson input as shown below:

.. include:: lenet5/lasagne/config
    :literal:


.. _ExampleB:

Example B - BinaryConnect on CIFAR-10
-------------------------------------

You need to have Lasagne installed to run this example.

The network has been trained with binary weights and can be tested using either
full-precision or binary weights. Set the ``binarize_weights`` option
accordingly.

.. include:: binaryconnect/config
    :literal:

.. _ExampleC:

Example C - BinaryNet on CIFAR-10
---------------------------------

You need to have Lasagne installed to run this example.

This network is like BinaryConnect, but in addition to binary weights also uses
binary activations.

Note how we turn off ``normalize`` in ``tools``. Parameter normalization is not
required here because activations never exceed threshold anyways.

.. include:: binarynet/config
    :literal:

.. _ExampleD:

Example D - VGG-16 on ImageNet
------------------------------

This example shows how to use ``jpg`` images as ``dataset_format``. Options
that are needed for this include ``class_idx_path``, ``datagen_kwargs``, and
``dataflow_kwargs``.

Further, we use a membrane clamp to reduce transient neuron dynamics in the
beginning of the simulation. For this, we set the ``filename_clamp_indices``
option.

For memory reasons we do not include the model file here, but the example
should work when instantiating VGG-16 from the Keras model zoo.

.. include:: vgg16/config
    :literal:

.. _ExampleE:

Example E - Inception-V3 on ImageNet
------------------------------------

If we want the Keras.ImageDataGenerator to perform some kind of preprocessing
on the data, we need to pass a ``preprocessing_function`` to the
``datagen_kwargs``. This can be done by simply giving the name of a python
module containing the preprocessing function. The toolbox will import and use
the function from there.

.. include:: inceptionV3/config
    :literal:
